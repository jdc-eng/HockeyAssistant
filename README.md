# HockeyAssistant

This is a very simple Python web scraping application that retrieves roster information for NCAA Men's Ice Hockey teams. 
The tkinter GUI takes in inputs of the desired team's roster website, the team's Elite Prospects site, and the USCHO URL of the team's most recent game.
It will retrieve the teams roster from its most recent game, each player information such as weight, handedness, and plus minus, and output it in the standard roster format in an Excel file.
